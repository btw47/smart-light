The purpose of this application is to learn about websockets and to apply my current knowledge in a small IoT application.

Client: Ionic 3
Server: Node.js with Socket.io

A RaspberryPi will be wired into a relay that will be used to control a light via the Ionic 3 application.

Based off the tutorial: https://www.jaredwolff.com/raspberry-pi-getting-interactive-with-your-server-using-websockets/
